3. THE MOST WIDELY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS ARABIC
This may be a somewhat surprising fun fact about Africa. Due to the fact that there are 54 countries in Africa, there are many different languages spoken. However, the most widely spoken language here is Arabic (by 170 million people), followed by English (by 130 million people) then Swahili, French, Bereber, Hausa and Portuguese. There are also many different languages that are spoken here which we doubt that you have even heard of…</br>

4. THERE ARE MORE THAN 2,000 RECOGNISED LANGUAGES
Over a quarter of all of the different languages that are spoken in the world are spoken in Africa in their relative regions. There are over 2,000 different recognised languages spoken in Africa, around 200 of these are spoken in Northern Africa including Central Sahara and are known as Afro-Asiatic languages, 140 are spoken in Central and Eastern Africa known as Nilo-Saharan languages and more than 1,000 are Niger-Saharan languages.</br>

5. ILLITERACY IS AS HIGH AS 40% ACROSS THE CONTINENT
Although Africa holds many different resources it is a continent where many of the countries have vast numbers of their populations living in poverty. This has led to 40% of adults in Africa being illiterate. The worst affected areas, with shocking illiteracy over 50% are in Ethiopia, Chad, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso.
